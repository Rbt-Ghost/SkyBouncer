## 🧠 Development Notes

This project represents my **first steps in Unity game development**, made under the guidance of  
[**Game Maker’s Toolkit** on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&t=4s).  

While the base concept follows the tutorial’s structure, the final game includes my **own custom features and improvements** such as procedural cloud generation, sound system, and scoring persistence.
